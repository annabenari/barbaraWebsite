            <h4>Supervision</h4>
            <p>I've been a counseling supervisor since 2005, overseeing diverse settings such as helpline volunteers,
                staff teams aiding homeless youth, individual therapists, and social work students. My integrative style
                blends academic knowledge with hands-on experience, enabling me to support professionals grappling with
                stress or burnout. Whether you're a counselor seeking supervision or another professional needing
                guidance, I'm here to help. I also specialize in group supervision, offering an enriching environment
                for shared learning and cost-effective support. Contact me for a chat about how I can assist you.</p>

            <h4>Relationship Counseling</h4>
            <p>In relationships, challenges abound, but therapy offers a guiding light. While outcomes aren't
                guaranteed, therapy equips you with skills to navigate turmoil. Whether with a partner, family, or
                friends, therapy fosters a positive path forward.</p>
