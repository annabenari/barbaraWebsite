            <h3>Supervision</h3>
            <p>
                I have worked as a counselling supervisor since 2005 in various settings, including:
            </p>
            <ul class="supervision-list">
                <li>Supervising groups of volunteers on helplines</li>
                <li>Guiding staff teams working with homeless youth</li>
                <li>Supporting individual therapists in private practice and organizations</li>
                <li>Training and supervising counselling and social work students</li>
                <li>Providing supervision for teachers and school staff</li>
                <li>Offering guidance to youth workers, foster carers, and pre-school staff</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I adopt an integrative style, incorporating academic knowledge and practical experience. I specialize in
                supporting professionals dealing with stress, overwhelm, and burnout.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether you're a counsellor seeking supervision or another professional needing guidance, feel free to
                reach out for a chat to see if I'm the right fit for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also have extensive experience leading small groups of therapists in supervision sessions. This
                collaborative approach not only enriches learning but also helps manage costs effectively.
            </p>
            <h4>Fee</h4>
            <p>£60 per session</p>
            <p>Groups of up to 4 people will have a duration of 2 hours and cost £120.</p>
